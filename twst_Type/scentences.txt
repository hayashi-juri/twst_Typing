Oh my. I am ever grateful for your support.
Much obliged. I'll do everything in my power to meet your expectations.
This feels magnificent, actually.
Even I'm shocked that I have such power in me. Not bad at all.
It's odd. At first, I thought you were a rather dull human, but now- oh, don't be angry. I don't think that anymore.
